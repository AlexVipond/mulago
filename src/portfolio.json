      "The first few years of life are critical for cognitive development. Parents can boost that development with simple interactions. Dost helps illiterate moms build skills to get their kids ready to succeed in school and life. They create and deliver short, engaging ‘phonecasts’ with tips and activities to build brains and give kids a needed head start. It’s an easy and fun way for illiterate parents to help their kids learn “school readiness”skills (pre-numeracy, pre-literacy, social, emotional, and self-regulation). The inherent scalability of Dost's technology makes it a potential solution for families from the slums of Delhi to rural Rajasthan."

Educate Girls is a rare example of a scalable, high-impact education solution that unlocks mandated funding and taps into existing school infrastructure. Their solution works and continues to achieve impressive enrollment and learning outcomes as it rapidly scales."

Their approach was designed to be implemented by others: Luminos provides the curriculum, monitoring efforts, and in some cases the funding for other organizations to deliver the program.

      "Small and medium agricultural businesses play an essential role in getting Africa’s smallholder farmers out of poverty – they are a major source of seasonal employment and connect farmers to markets.  But they often don’t have access to the right capital to grow as most major lenders find these agri-businesses risky and difficult to invest in. Aceli addresses this financing gap – they help high-impact agri-businesses become investment ready, and provide lenders with targeted subsidies to reduce their risk and encourage more loans. Successful agri-businesses can drive stronger rural economies and better livelihoods for smallholder farmers."

      "Cassava is a staple smallholder crop all over Africa. There’s a lot to like: it is climate resilient, it nourishes the soil, and there’s growing global demand, especially as a gluten-free starch. There’s also a huge problem: it must be processed within three days, or it goes bad. Farmers routinely lose 40% of their crop, so they hedge by only using a fraction of their land. ",
      "CassVita has developed a treatment that extends cassava’s shelf life to 18 months by making it think it’s still in the ground. Farmers can now grow more, lose less, and earn more. The product is easy to use, requiring only a simple chemical bath for about an hour, and it integrates well with existing co-op structures.",
      "Initial trials show significant income increases for farmers, with even greater potential if they plant more cassava on unused land. If this becomes the ubiquitous way to farm cassava, there is no reason to believe this can’t boost cassava farmers’ incomes all over Africa."

Hello Tractor works like Uber to get tractor services to smallholder farmers. Their inexpensive tracking device and software allow farmers and tractor owners to book connected tractors from their phones. Farmers get a critical service formerly unavailable to them, banks see an asset recovery solution, dealers and fleet owners see a fleet optimization opportunity, and government see a low-cost way to manage large-scale mechanization schemes.

They underinvest because they cannot risk a poor return if rains come late or pests wipe out their crop – both now common given climate change.  Pula gets agricultural insurance products to smallholder farmers so they can invest more in their farms. They help clients - seed and fertilizer companies, NGOs, financial institutions, and government programs - design and deliver insurance products that are bundled together with seeds, fertilizer and farm loans. Input and crop yield insurance could be powerful risk mitigation tools in smallholder agriculture, particularly when coupled with Pula's farm advisory services."

When a young person graduates from university, their income and employment opportunities increase dramatically–with ripple effects across their entire family. But too many kids can’t afford college and traditional loans are too onerous to repay. Chancen is a non-profit fund manager pioneering ethical Income Share Agreements (ISAs) to finance college education for low-income students in Africa. In contrast to a traditional loan with a fixed monthly payment, these agreements allow students to repay their education expenses as a percentage of their post-education salary for a set number of years. If a student isn’t earning income, they do not fall behind on payments- and total repayment is capped to ensure high earners aren’t penalized. Chancen’s agreements provide flexible terms that could lead to durable prosperity for millions of students and their families across Africa."

      "Despite rising higher education levels in India, millions of people who graduate from technical and vocational programs lack the basic soft skills necessary to get hired and begin a thriving career. At the same time, local blue-collar employers struggle to find quality talent with on-the-job experience.  Medha embeds career coaching in low-resource public education institutions so that low-income youth get jobs that pay well and that they like. ",
      "Medha’s well trained counselors help students find the right career pathway, teach them employability skills - critical thinking, creativity, collaboration and communication - and get students quality internships so they can test out different career paths. There’s a growing Medha alumni network that provides further career opportunities and peer support. It’s a simple model that’s already being delivered by government in two states with a strategy to scale to every public institution in North India."

      "An African woman suffering from depression makes less money, and her physical health – and the health of her children – is worse. And yet most people in Africa that need care for depression do not get it because there are not enough trained psychologists to meet the need. Friendship Bench’s big idea is that ordinary people - even grandmothers - can provide talk based therapy to reduce depression.  In Zimbabwe, where they were founded, Grandmothers are trained to deliver talk-based therapy to people struggling with depression, who are then plugged into a long-term peer support group. Evidence shows that this low-cost intervention works – an RCT found an 80% reduction in depression and suicidal thoughts after 6 months.  This solution can help get mental healthcare within walking distance for all. "

      "In poor countries, families play a much bigger role in health care for their loved ones, both in the hospital and after they have gone home. The failure to engage them leads to worse outcomes for the patient and represents a huge waste of potential. Noora Health teaches families how to care for their loved ones during and after a hospital stay.  They design high-impact health skills training materials that are delivered by hospital staff and over WhatsApp so family members learn what they need to know to take care of their loved ones. They focus on things like wound care, simple physical therapy and proper medication dosing. Noora Health’s low-cost skill training works – they have seen a spectacular 71% reduction in post-surgical complications."

Semilla Nueva develops, produces, and sells seeds to grow maize with twice the protein and 50% more zinc than varieties currently on the market. Moreover, they’re clever about marketing; consumers buy for taste and farmers buy for yield, so those are the traits they emphasize and deliver on. They’ve established a seed company to demonstrate that these seeds can be sold at a competitive price on the basis of better taste and increased yield. They started in Guatemala, which has one of the highest rates of malnutrition in the world, and will move to other maize-dependent countries from there."

      "First, they ask parents over the phone to identify key influencers in their community. Then, they invite and onboard these nominees as “immunization ambassadors.” Once onboard, important information about vaccination schedules is texted to these ambassadors for them to share with parents. At the same time, Suvita sends texts directly to parents to remind them of their responsibilities. Early, rigorous studies of this model showed a big increase in vaccinations at low additional cost. Suvita is refining the model to make it an integral part of government vaccination campaigns."

Many of the best social organizations already use text and voice message platforms to push information to clients: the ability to have a two-way conversation opens whole new worlds of impact. As data gets cheap (already a reality in India), WhatsApp and similar tools enable much more sophisticated communication, including video and personalized information. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning means that these connections can become more effective and (surprisingly) more personalized.

      "Too often, health systems in poor countries can't get life-saving health products and services to the people who need them most.  VillageReach puts high-performance management systems in place to make sure that vaccines, medicines, and medical supplies get to the people who need them most - they call it \"going the last mile.\"  In Mozambique, VillageReach’s flagship logistics project achieved much higher vaccination rates, dramatic reductions in drug stock-outs and lower government operating costs. They're now a leading player in the international effort to prioritize and execute a re-design of vaccine supply chains across Africa.",
      "VillageReach is one of a bunch of primary healthcare organizations in Mulago’s portfolio self-organized into the Community Health Impact Coalition (CHIC). As individual organizations, they’ve each had outstanding impact and integration with their governments partners. But together they’ve created a movement that could be the impact jackpot. They speak with a louder voice when they call collectively for all community health workers to be salaried, skilled, supervised, supplied & incorporated into national strategies in order to achieve health for all."

We’ve been consistently impressed by WSUP’s ability to influence public and private service providers to prioritize water and sanitation services for the urban poor. From Dhaka to Lusaka, they know who the crucial players are, and how to get them to work together.

Accompaniment helps communities become government-supported stewards of their own resources, secure land tenure and get basic services like education, healthcare, and livelihood support. Their work with indigenous governments was instrumental in the Colombian government’s recognition of 25M hectares of indigenous territory in the Colombian Amazon, an area bigger than California, and Gaia’s methodology for Accompaniment could work across the wider Amazon Basin."

      "Deforestation harms communities through local, regional and global ecosystem effects. Global Forest Watch, a program of World Resources Institute, monitors the world’s forests in near-real time and provides open access to information about where, when and why forests are disappearing. Global Forest Watch’s platform allows ongoing monitoring of forest loss and gain at high resolution with satellite imagery. They then support public and private sector actors to use this powerful information to combat tropical deforestation. This is a critical resource for any organization working to maintain the ecosystem services provided by intact forest."

Their model is backed by several peer-reviewed studies that show a 4X population increase of protected species over ten years. They aim to create a viable market for these species, starting with the arapaima fish (which has a huge market - and is itself huge!). If it works for arapaima, their model is highly relevant for other products with high social and environmental value."

They do this through advocacy, engagement with civil service staff, and a coalition of high-impact organizations (including many from Mulago’s portfolio). Unlock Aid has a cheap, systematic approach to change development funding policies and practices, and it works."

They use everyday technology, like phones and websites, to get people involved in campaigns. What sets them apart is their rigorous focus on outcomes and accountability. If the decision-maker ignores their demands, fails to deliver on time, or only partially delivers, they nonviolently escalate things with more public pressure. And, if they win the campaign, they build on the campaign momentum to get bigger wins for related issues. They are experimenting with ways to make participation in campaigns free so that it’s easier for more people to join and have their voice heard."

Credit might be available, but it is often at an exorbitant cost. myAgro helps smallholder farmers save so they can buy fertilizer and seeds at planting time.  Whenever farmers have a little money, they can buy scratch cards from local agents – just like those used for mobile airtime – and send the money into a layaway account for the next planting season.  At planting time, myAgro delivers the fertilizer and seeds and trains the farmers how to use them well. This combination is a solution that can improve farmer livelihoods across Africa."

      "Thousands of poor women and newborns in remote areas die every day during pregnancy and delivery.  Most of these deaths can be prevented with basic interventions. One Heart Worldwide ensures that rural pregnant women get prenatal care and have safe deliveries. They help local governments upgrade birthing centers, equip them properly, train staff and community workers, and establish good management. In Baglung, a Nepalese district of 300,000 people, the maternal mortality rate dropped 90% in three years.  With government support, One Heart has expanded sites that serve a population of 3 million people and nearly 80,000 pregnancies each year. Once the system is working well, they ratchet down their involvement and monitor results to sustain quality over the long term."

      "Zola sells solar electricity – not equipment – to households in Africa. They install their own hardware and software in a customer's home and then charge their customer for energy use via a mobile payment system. This is the first credible energy company we've seen targeting very poor people with a high quality, household lighting product they can afford."
