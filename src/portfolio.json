      "A college degree is one of the most powerful ways to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. When a young person graduates from university, their income and employment opportunities increase dramatically–with ripple effects across their entire family. But too many kids can’t afford college and traditional loans are too onerous to repay. Chancen is a non-profit fund manager pioneering ethical Income Share Agreements (ISAs) to finance college education for low-income students in Africa. In contrast to a traditional loan with a fixed monthly payment, these agreements allow students to repay their education expenses as a percentage of their post-education salary for a set number of years. If a student isn’t earning income, they do not fall behind on payments- and total repayment is capped to ensure high earners aren’t penalized. Chancen’s agreements provide flexible terms that could lead to durable prosperity for millions of students and their families across Africa."

It’s an easy and fun way for illiterate parents to help their kids learn “school readiness”skills (pre-numeracy, pre-literacy, social, emotional, and self-regulation). The inherent scalability of Dost's technology makes it a potential solution for families from the slums of Delhi to rural Rajasthan."

Credit might be available, but it is often at an exorbitant cost. myAgro helps smallholder farmers save so they can buy fertilizer and seeds at planting time.  Whenever farmers have a little money, they can buy scratch cards from local agents – just like those used for mobile airtime – and send the money into a layaway account for the next planting season.  At planting time, myAgro delivers the fertilizer and seeds and trains the farmers how to use them well. This combination is a solution that can improve farmer livelihoods across Africa."

They underinvest because they cannot risk a poor return if rains come late or pests wipe out their crop – both now common given climate change.  Pula gets agricultural insurance products to smallholder farmers so they can invest more in their farms. They help clients - seed and fertilizer companies, NGOs, financial institutions, and government programs - design and deliver insurance products that are bundled together with seeds, fertilizer and farm loans.

      "An African woman suffering from depression makes less money, and her physical health – and the health of her children – is worse. And yet most people in Africa that need care for depression do not get it because there are not enough trained psychologists to meet the need. Friendship Bench’s big idea is that ordinary people - even grandmothers - can provide talk based therapy to reduce depression.  In Zimbabwe, where they were founded, Grandmothers are trained to deliver talk-based therapy to people struggling with depression, who are then plugged into a long-term peer support group. Evidence shows that this low-cost intervention works – an RCT found an 80% reduction in depression and suicidal thoughts after 6 months.  This solution can help get mental healthcare within walking distance for all. "

      "Thousands of poor women and newborns in remote areas die every day during pregnancy and delivery.  Most of these deaths can be prevented with basic interventions. One Heart Worldwide ensures that rural pregnant women get prenatal care and have safe deliveries. They help local governments upgrade birthing centers, equip them properly, train staff and community workers, and establish good management. In Baglung, a Nepalese district of 300,000 people, the maternal mortality rate dropped 90% in three years.  With government support, One Heart has expanded sites that serve a population of 3 million people and nearly 80,000 pregnancies each year. Once the system is working well, they ratchet down their involvement and monitor results to sustain quality over the long term."

Moreover, they’re clever about marketing; consumers buy for taste and farmers buy for yield, so those are the traits they emphasize and deliver on. They’ve established a seed company to demonstrate that these seeds can be sold at a competitive price on the basis of better taste and increased yield. They started in Guatemala, which has one of the highest rates of malnutrition in the world, and will move to other maize-dependent countries from there."

Many of the best social organizations already use text and voice message platforms to push information to clients: the ability to have a two-way conversation opens whole new worlds of impact. As data gets cheap (already a reality in India), WhatsApp and similar tools enable much more sophisticated communication, including video and personalized information.

    "why": [
      "When conservation is divorced from development, it fails. COMACO turns unproductive Zambian farmers and poachers into productive farmers through training and access to markets.  COMACO’s food business, It’s Wild, buys commodity crops from farmers and creates value-added products, like peanut butter, sold in supermarkets.  Farmers who adopt improved land use and farming practices that promote natural resource conservation are paid a premium for their crops.  ",
      "COMACO is a success: more than 1 million people are better off and environmental indicators have improved across the enormous Luangwa Valley ecosystem.  In stark contrast with what’s happening across much of southern Africa, wildlife numbers appear to be stable. This is the best conservation effort involving smallholder farmers that we’ve ever seen: COMACO is a market-based conservation solution that works."

      "Foundation for Ecological Security (FES) has reimagined the tragedy of the commons as the promise of the commons. Commons are pastures or forests technically owned by government, though villagers use them for activities like grazing, collecting firewood, and sourcing water. FES helps communities organize themselves and secure legal rights to this shared land, access government funding, and then manage the land. They’ve demonstrated that secure tenure and a shared resource management plan for common areas can restore degraded lands, with dramatic increases in biomass and hydrologic function. This ecosystem restoration offers huge potential benefits to poor farmers and has the potential to scale throughout India."

      "The Amazon Basin is under increasing pressure from farming, ranching, illegal mining, and burning. There is a growing consensus that indigenous management is the best and cheapest way to protect ecosystems. Gaia Amazonas has spent forty years developing long-term partnerships with indigenous Amazon communities – they call this Accompaniment – that protect forest health and indigenous rights. Accompaniment helps communities become government-supported stewards of their own resources, secure land tenure and get basic services like education, healthcare, and livelihood support. Their work with indigenous governments was instrumental in the Colombian government’s recognition of 25M hectares of indigenous territory in the Colombian Amazon, an area bigger than California, and Gaia’s methodology for Accompaniment could work across the wider Amazon Basin."

Global Forest Watch’s platform allows ongoing monitoring of forest loss and gain at high resolution with satellite imagery. They then support public and private sector actors to use this powerful information to combat tropical deforestation. This is a critical resource for any organization working to maintain the ecosystem services provided by intact forest."

      "Financial institutions continue to pour billions into the fossil fuel industry.  Interrupting the flow is crucial to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis, which will hit poor communities the hardest.  Before you can stop the flow of funds you have to know who is sending how much money where.  To disrupt the finance of dirty-industry, Urgewald traces the flow of money to fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas and then publishes user-friendly databases. They persuade financial institutions to stop investing in fossil fuels by: 1) showing them the damage they’re doing, 2) creating reputational risk, and 3) mounting public campaigns. They then give them simple, industry-standard investment policies that exclude fossil fuels.",
      "Urgewald has influenced the policies of many leading financial institutions so far, including Europe’s largest pension fund, and work strategically with regulators to adopt and enforce investment policies that exclude fossil fuel. Their successes have motivated other environmental organizations to adopt Urgewald’s approach, and they now partner with local NGOs to run effective public pressure campaigns around the globe.
